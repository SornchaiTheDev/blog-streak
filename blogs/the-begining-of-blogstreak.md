Title: The begining of BlogStreak
---

So in this blog post I'm gonna write down about how this website will make with.
Recently I love to take a deep dive into Go programming language so I think I'm gonna use GO + HTMX to make this website.
I have tried to read the HTMX docs and I think it's really simple to make a website that doesn't require a lot of client-side functinal interaction because it highly focus on replacing the DOM with server request which response in HTML form. (By the way, If the website has a lot of Javascript functinality I highly recommend Rect.js or Next.js). I think this is the end of this blog post because I'm so sleepy right now. See ya ! ðŸ˜´
