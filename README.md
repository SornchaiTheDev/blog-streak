# Blog Streak ðŸ”¥

I made this website for my new year resolution to create a blog post everyday by using a gamification technique (Streak) like in the Duolingo or Locket app

## Stacks

- Go
- Templ
- HTMX

## Achivement

- use `net/http` package to handle request
- first time using Go Routine with Channel and WaitGroup
- first time using [Templ](https://templ.guide)
- first time using [HTMX](https://htmx.org)
- first time using `os` package
- first time try to parse md file with [goldmark](https://github.com/yuin/goldmark)

## Usage

Create a new blog for today

```bash
go run ./cmd/cli/cli.go --name <name>
```

You can use `" "` when blog name has space
